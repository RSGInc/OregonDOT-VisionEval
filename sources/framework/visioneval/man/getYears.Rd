\description{
\code{getYears} a visioneval framework model user function that reads the
Years component from the the model state file.
}
\details{
This is a convenience function to make it easier to retrieve the Years
component of the model state file which lists all of the specified model run
years. If the Years component includes the base year, then the returned
vector of years places the base year first in the order. This ordering is
important because some modules calculate future year values by pivoting off
of base year values so the base year must be run first.
